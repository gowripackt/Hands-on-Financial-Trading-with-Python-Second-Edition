        "\n",
        "If you have worked through Notebook 2.1, you are comfortable with Pandas. You can create DataFrames, manipulate time series, and combine datasets. So why do you need another library?\n",
        "\n",
        "The answer is that Pandas is built on NumPy. Every time you perform a calculation in Pandas, NumPy is doing the heavy lifting under the hood. The DataFrame you see on screen is essentially a collection of NumPy arrays with labels attached.\n",
        "\n",
        "For most day-to-day work, you do not need to think about this. Pandas handles everything for you. But there are three situations where you need to work with NumPy directly:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Speed:** When you need maximum performance for large datasets or repeated calculations, working directly with NumPy arrays is faster than Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Machine Learning:** Libraries like scikit-learn expect NumPy arrays as input, not DataFrames. You need to know how to extract arrays from your DataFrames and reshape them correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Matrix Math:** Portfolio optimization, covariance matrices, and other financial calculations require matrix operations that NumPy handles natively.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will teach you what you need to know to work confidently with NumPy in a financial context."

        "\n",
        "Before we dive into creating arrays, you need to understand how they differ from the DataFrames you already know. They are related but serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**DataFrames have labels. Arrays do not.**\n",
        "\n",
        "A DataFrame has an index (row labels) and column names. These labels make it easy to slice data by date or select a column by name. An array is just numbers. No labels. If you want the third row, you ask for row index 2. There is no concept of asking for the row labeled \"2024-07-03\".\n",
        "\n",
        "**DataFrames can hold mixed data types. Arrays cannot.**\n",
        "\n",
        "A DataFrame can have one column of strings, another of floats, and another of integers. Each column maintains its own data type. An array requires all elements to be the same type. If you mix types, NumPy will convert everything to a common type, often in ways you did not expect. We will cover this in detail shortly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**DataFrames are built for tabular data. Arrays can be any shape.**\n",
        "\n",
        "DataFrames are always two-dimensional: rows and columns. Arrays can be one-dimensional (a single series of numbers), two-dimensional (a matrix), three-dimensional (a cube of numbers), or higher. This flexibility is essential for machine learning where you often work with multi-dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**DataFrames have built-in time series methods. Arrays are for raw computation.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Methods like `.resample()`, `.rolling()`, and `.shift()` are Pandas features. NumPy arrays do not have these. Arrays are designed for fast numerical computation, not for time series manipulation.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Arrays vs DataFrames:** Arrays are fast and unlabeled. DataFrames are convenient and labeled. Use Pandas for data preparation and exploration. Use NumPy for computation and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vectorization:** Think in arrays, not loops. Vectorized operations are faster and cleaner. When you catch yourself writing a for loop over numerical data, pause and look for a vectorized solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Shape:** Most errors in machine learning come from shape mismatches. A 1D array with shape `(n,)` is not the same as a 2D array with shape `(n, 1)`. Use `.reshape(-1, 1)` to fix single-feature inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Broadcasting:** NumPy stretches smaller arrays to match larger ones. This simplifies calculations like subtracting the risk-free rate or normalizing returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Matrix Operations:** Portfolio returns are a dot product. Portfolio variance uses the covariance matrix. These calculations scale to any number of assets."
