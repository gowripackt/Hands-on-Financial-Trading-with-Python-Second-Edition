        "**What Are Functions?**\n",
        "- A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.\n",
        "- Functions are like a \"recipe\" in cooking: they take input (ingredients), perform actions (steps), and may produce an output (the final dish).\n",
        "- Functions allow you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits of Using Functions**\n",
        "1. Reusability: Write code once and use it multiple times without repeating yourself.\n",
        "  - Example: A function to calculate daily returns can be reused for any stock in your portfolio.\n",
        "2. Readability: Code becomes easier to read and understand because functions group related logic together.\n",
        "  - Example: Instead of writing multiple lines of the same logic, a single function call simplifies it.\n",
        "3. Modularity: Functions help you break down a large program into smaller, independent parts.\n",
        "  - Example: If you are building a backtesting system, separate functions can handle signal generation, position sizing, and performance calculation.\n",
        "4. Debugging: Errors are easier to identify and fix when your code is divided into small, functional blocks.\n",
        "  - Example: If a function produces the wrong result, you only need to focus on that specific block of code.\n",
        "5. Scalability: Functions make it easier to expand your program as your requirements grow.\n",
        "  - Example: Adding a new feature to a function is simpler than modifying repetitive code in multiple places."

        "- In our example, the function name is market_open.\n",

        "3. **Parameters (Arguments) and Parentheses**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Parentheses () follow the function name. Inside these parentheses, you can define parameters, which are placeholders for the data your function can accept.\n",

        "- The body of the function contains the code that will run when the function is called.\n",

        "5. Output:\n",
        "\n",

        "**Function Basics:** Functions take inputs, perform a task, and return outputs. They make your code reusable, readable, and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parameters and Arguments:** Use positional and keyword arguments to make functions flexible. Default parameters handle common cases automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scope:** Variables inside functions are local. Use the `global` keyword sparingly. Pass data through arguments and return values instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Type Hints:** Document what your functions expect and return. This prevents errors and makes your code self-documenting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Modular Design:** Break complex problems into smaller functions. Call functions from within other functions to build complete workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "The common thread: functions transform loose scripts into robust systems. Every trading strategy in this book is built from functions."
