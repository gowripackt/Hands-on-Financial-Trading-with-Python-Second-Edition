Financial datasets, such as stock prices, returns, and volumes, often span large time periods and involve multiple variables. The ability to extract specific subsets of data—whether by position, label, or exact value—allows analysts to focus on relevant information, perform precise calculations, and identify key trends. Methods like .iloc, .loc, and .at empower users to navigate complex datasets with ease, making it possible to filter by date ranges, isolate specific securities, and retrieve individual values. Mastering these tools is essential for tasks such as portfolio analysis, strategy backtesting, and financial reporting, where accuracy and efficiency are paramount.\n",

        "Filtering DataFrames is a fundamental skill for financial analysis, allowing you to extract and work with subsets of data that meet specific criteria. For example, you might want to isolate days where a stock's adjusted closing price exceeded a certain value or identify high-volume trading days. By defining conditions such as >, <, >=, and combining multiple conditions with logical operators (&, |, ~), you can quickly narrow your focus to the most relevant data for your analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the heart of filtering is the concept of a Boolean mask. A Boolean mask is a series of True or False values generated by evaluating a condition on a DataFrame or Series. This mask is used to filter rows where the condition is True, effectively creating a new subset of data. Boolean masks are crucial because they make the filtering process efficient and intuitive, allowing you to apply conditions directly to your data without requiring complex loops or manual selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether you're identifying trends, evaluating trading strategies, or preparing data for visualization, mastering filtering ensures that you can work with clean, targeted datasets tailored to your needs. This section will demonstrate how to filter data based on single and multiple conditions, and how to refine the results to include only specific columns.\n"

        "Vectorization is one of the most powerful concepts in data analysis, allowing operations to be applied across entire datasets at once, rather than iterating through individual elements. This approach leverages the optimized, low-level implementation of operations in libraries like Pandas and NumPy, resulting in significant speed improvements and more concise, readable code.\n",

        "1. Speed:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Vectorized operations are highly optimized and can be orders of magnitude faster than equivalent operations using Python loops.\n",
        "- They take advantage of compiled C code under the hood, avoiding the overhead of Python's interpreted loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Simplicity:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Code using vectorization is more concise, easier to read, and less error-prone compared to loops.\n",
        "- A single line of vectorized code can replace many lines of loop-based logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Scalability:\n",

        "- Vectorized operations scale well to large datasets, which is critical in finance when dealing with millions of rows of time-series or trade data.\n",

        "\n",
        "You likely are getting setting with copy warnings. We need to address that now so that you understand what is causing it and how to avoid it, since you will likely encounter it OFTEN when coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "The SettingWithCopyWarning appears when you attempt to modify a slice of a DataFrame, which may be a view rather than a new, independent copy. This warning is Pandas' way of alerting you that changes might not behave as expected. For example, modifying the slice may or may not affect the original DataFrame, leading to unpredictable results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, Pandas can get confused when doing these kinds of operations. This is why, it often better to create a copy of a dataframe using `df2 = df1.copy()` and then working with the copy.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, always check whether you are working with a copy or a slice of the original DataFrame. Using .copy() or .loc[] ensures clarity and avoids unexpected behavior. **This is critical for maintaining data integrity**, especially when modifying filtered subsets of your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the \"best practices\" to deal with this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use `.copy()`: When creating a new DataFrame from a filtered slice, always use `.copy()` to ensure you're working with an independent copy.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Example: `df_spy_copy = df_spy[df_spy['Adj Close'] > 150].copy()`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Use `.loc[]` for Assignment: When modifying values in a DataFrame, use `.loc[]` to explicitly specify the rows and columns you want to update.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Example: `df_spy.loc[df_spy['Adj Close'] > 150, 'Volume (M)'] = df_spy['Volume'] / 1_000_000`\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Understand the Warning: If you're certain your changes won't affect the original DataFrame, the warning can usually be ignored. However, using `.copy()` is safer and avoids ambiguity."

        "\n",
        "Everything we've done so far has been about understanding the structure of our data and basic calculations. But trading strategies require us to look at data *over time*: What was the average price over the last 20 days? What was yesterday's close? What is the cumulative return since we started? How do I convert daily prices to monthly returns?\n",

        "2. `.shift()` — Accessing previous or future values (lagging and leading)\n",

        "\n",
        "**What It Does:** The `.rolling()` method creates a \"sliding window\" over your data, allowing you to perform calculations across a specified number of rows. Think of it as a window that moves down your DataFrame, one row at a time, performing a calculation at each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why It's Important:** Moving averages are the foundation of countless trading strategies. When you hear someone say \"the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average,\" they are talking about `.rolling()`. Beyond moving averages, you can calculate rolling standard deviations (for volatility), rolling sums, rolling min/max, and much more.\n",

        "**When to Use It:**\n",
        "- Calculating moving averages for trend-following strategies\n",

        "- Smoothing noisy data to identify underlying trends\n",
        "- Building indicators like Bollinger Bands (which use rolling mean and rolling standard deviation)\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **For prices, use `.last()`** — You want the closing price at the end of the period. The last price of the month is the month-end price. Using `.mean()` would give you the average price during the month, which is not what you typically want for calculating returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **For volume, use `.sum()`** — Volume is cumulative. If you traded 1 million shares on Monday and 2 million on Tuesday, the weekly volume is 3 million. Using `.last()` would only give you Tuesday's volume and throw away Monday's data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **For returns, be careful** — If you have daily returns and want monthly returns, you cannot simply use `.sum()` or `.mean()`. You must compound them using the formula we learned: `(1 + daily_returns).resample('ME').prod() - 1`\n",

        "- **DataFrames and Series** are the foundation of everything. You now know how to create, inspect, and navigate these structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Time-series operations** like `.rolling()`, `.shift()`, `.cumsum()`, `.cumprod()`, and `.resample()` are the building blocks of trading strategies. You will use these constantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Combining DataFrames** is where many beginners make silent, costly mistakes. You now understand the jagged edge problem and know when to use `pd.concat()`, `df.join()`, and `pd.merge()`. More importantly, you know why `df.join()` with an explicit `how` parameter is the safest choice for financial time-series work.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reshaping data** with `df.pivot()`, `pd.melt()`, and `.pivot_table()` gives you the flexibility to transform your data into whatever structure your analysis requires.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is your reference manual. As you work through the rest of the book, you will come back to these methods again and again. Do not try to memorize everything. Instead, understand the concepts and know where to look when you need a refresher.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Notebook 2.2, we will explore NumPy, the hidden engine that powers Pandas. You will learn why vectorization matters, how to prepare your data for machine learning, and how to avoid common pitfalls when working with arrays.\n",
